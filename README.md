# EcoRacer

EcoRacer is an online game developed for use in academic research. It was originally developed by [A, B, C] at University of Michigan as part of a PhD dissertation. The software has since evolved for further reasearch work under the guidance of A. E. Bayrak at Stevens Institute of Technology.

The game is a 2D side-scroller electric-vehicle racing game where the objective is to finish the track given a set of constraints:
* Before playing, the player is able to customize the gear ratio of the vehicle, this impacts battery usage and acceleration.
* During game play, the player's control options are to accelerate, coast, or brake
  * Acceleration consumes battery power
  * Braking regenerates battery power
* The game ends when
  * The time constraint expires, there is a time limit on completing the track.
  * The vehicle crosses the finish line, the player is awarded points for time and remaining battery charge.
